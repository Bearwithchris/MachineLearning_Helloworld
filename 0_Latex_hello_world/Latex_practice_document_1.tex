This is a random cluster of text which I've used to describe section 1 data.

%insertion of a quote that has a indented block 
\begin{quote}
Some wise quote in which, deserves its own block separated from the rest, an elite set of words some might say
\end{quote}

%starting of the second section
\section{Section 2}
This is a random cluster of text which I've used to describe section 2 data.
In this section we need to have a list of random words that describe absolutely nothing
\begin{itemize}
\item tomato
\item guava juice
\item pen and paper
\item cellphone
\end{itemize}

Next we need to insert the same list but with numberings

\begin{enumerate}
\item tomato
\item guava juice
\item pen and paper
\item cellphone
\end{enumerate}

Alright enough nonsense of one page, lets start a new page
